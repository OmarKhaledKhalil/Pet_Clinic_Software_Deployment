🚀 Bet Clinic Infrastructure Configuration

This repository contains the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration for deploying the Bet Clinic application on AWS. It uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for post-deployment configuration, orchestrated via Azure DevOps Pipelines.

📦 Project Overview

Application: Bet Clinic (Deployed separately from the open-source GitHub repository)

Infrastructure Provider: AWS

CI/CD Platform: Azure DevOps Pipelines

IaC Tools:
Terraform: For provisioning resources like EC2 instances, VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, etc.
Ansible: For configuring Kubernetes on EC2 nodes

Cluster Design:
1 Master Node (Private Subnet)
2 Worker Nodes (Private Subnet)
1 Bastion Host (Public Subnet for SSH access)

Repositories:
App Code: GitHub - Bet Clinic App
Config Repo: This repository

⚙️ Azure DevOps Pipeline Overview

The infrastructure provisioning and configuration process is automated using Azure Pipelines, which includes:

Stages:

Terraform Init & Apply

Generate Inventory

Run Ansible Playbook

Each stage includes logging, state handling, and error checks.

🔐 Security Considerations

EC2 Key pairs and secrets are securely stored in Azure DevOps Library.

The Bastion host is the only public-facing machine.

Master and Worker nodes reside in private subnets.

📝 Usage
1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://dev.azure.com/omarkhaledahmed/bet-clinic-config.git

2. Setup Backend (Optional):
Update backend configuration in main.tf to store state remotely if needed.

3. Run the Pipeline:
Trigger the Azure DevOps pipeline manually or on every push to main.

🧪 Testing
After deployment, validate the Kubernetes setup with:

kubectl get nodes

Use the Bastion host to securely access the internal cluster.
